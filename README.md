## 1. Car Sales Statistics 
In this coding course, we learned how to plot various kinds of charts, including bar, scatter, box and etc and practiced the basic way to view the dataset and its info. Based on the 
charts we created we can also make the oberservations and tell the stories. For example, in plotting a chart to show relationship between 'Type' and 'Price' i first created a pivot table 
to show the average prices of each car type. With a bar plot showing their relationship we can tell the 'Midsize' cars are selling more expensive than other types of cars. 
### Key learning points 
1. DataFrame.info()
2. DataFrame.describe() #include='object' can be put in the () to show object type of info
3. DataFrame.head() #numbers of rows can be added in the ()
4. DataFrame[''].value_counts() #group and count aggregates based on category
5. DataFrame.corr #show correlations
6. DataFrame.plot.scatter/bar
7. DataFrame.boxplot()
## 2. EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
